subtitle: What is the rating system for companies in each blog post?
---

howdy all.


This blog will allow me to investigate the sustainability practices of companies, whether local to me in Austin or globally established. 
I want to allow myself an outlet where I can make note of which companies I trust and which ones I donâ€™t. 

Where I should spend my money and where I should not.


One blog post will be created per company I research, and I will rate each a value 1 to 5.

1 = bad sustainability practices, don't buy.
2 = some work has been done/said it's been done, but nothing really has changed. These companies fake sustainability.
3 = work has been done. Minor changes have been made. Some bad practices are still in place.
4 = lots of work has been done. Changes have been made and felt. No major flaws. perhaps some minor things left to work on.
5 = They spread sustainability like wildflower seed.

This system will by no means be complete nor condusive of a full understanding of the underworkings of each company. 
This measure is simply a way for me to remember which companies I will support with what little knowledge I may have. 
I just want to make a difference in my life by supporting those who work harder, work kinder, and work better.

This metric rating system is subject to change.

cheers!

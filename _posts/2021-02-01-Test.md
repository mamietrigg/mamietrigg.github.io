howdy. This is a sample blog post that is going to be how to learn how to upload a post. 
My idea is that I will create one blog post per company, and I will rate them 1-5.

<ol>
<li> = bad sustainability practices, don't buy.
<li> = some work has been done/said it's been done, but nothing really has changed. These companies fake sustainability.
<li> = work has been done. Minor changes have been made. Some bad practices are still in place.
<li> = lots of work has been done. Changes have been made and felt. No major flaws. perhaps some minor things left to work on.
<li> = They spread sustainability like wildflower seed.
</ol>

cheers!

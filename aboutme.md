subtitle: Why you'd want to get to know me

My name is Mamie Trigg. People often ask, so to save you the trouble, I pronounce my name like 'May-mee', rhyming with Amy! 
I am forever growing and changing, but here are some of my cornerstone traits/beliefs:

- To put my trust in luck, coincidence, and hard work; I believe we have the ability to pave our own way.
- To easily spot four-leaf-clovers in any patch of wild grass. This is my secret talent. I'm appreciative of the minute details and pocket beauties that our wild Earth has to offer. 
- To love reading fiction, camping under starlight, making roadtrip playlists, cooking mac 'n cheese, solving problems...
- To support sustainable practices and the National Park System, and to promote equality and love. 

There's much more to me, but it's difficult to encapsulate any person into 4 strict bullet points. Let's talk more - I always love to meet new people. 

Cheers,
Mamie

This blog will allow me to investigate the sustainability practices of companies, whether local to me in Austin or globally established. I want to allow myself an outlet where I can make note of which companies I trust and which ones I don't. Where should I spend my money and where I should not.

## how will I rate these companies? 

<br> 
One blog post will be created per company I research, and I will rate each a value 1 to 5.

<ul>
  <li> 1 = bad sustainability practices, don't buy.</li>
  <li> 2 = some work has been done/said it's been done, but nothing really has changed. These companies fake sustainability.</li>
  <li> 3 = work has been done. Minor changes have been made. Some bad practices are still in place.</li>
  <li> 4 = lots of work has been done. Changes have been made and felt. No major flaws. perhaps some minor things left to work on.</li>
  <li> 5 = They spread sustainability like wildflower seed.</li>
</ul>

<br> 
This system will by no means be complete nor condusive of a full understanding of the underworkings of each company. This measure is simply a way for me to remember which companies I will support with what little knowledge I may have. I just want to make a difference in my life by supporting those who work harder, work kinder, and work better.

This metric rating system is subject to change.

cheers!

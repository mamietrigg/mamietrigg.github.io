subtitle: Why you'd want to get to know me

My name is Mamie Trigg. People often ask, so to save you the trouble, I pronounce my name like 'May-mee', rhyming with Amy! 
I am forever growing and changing, but here are some of my cornerstone traits/beliefs:

- I put my trust in luck, coincidence, and hard work; I believe we have the ability to pave our own way.
- This is my secret talent: I can easily spot four-leaf-clovers in any patch of wild grass. I try to be appreciative of the minute details and pocket beauties that our wild Earth has to offer. 
- I love reading fiction, camping under starlight, making roadtrip playlists, cooking mac 'n cheese, solving problems...
- I support sustainable practices and the National Park System. 
- I promote equality and love. I try to be more patient.

There's much more to me, but it's difficult to encapsulate any person into 5 strict bullet points. Let's talk more - I always love to meet new people. 

Cheers,
Mamie
